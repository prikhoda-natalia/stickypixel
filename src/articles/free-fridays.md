Sticky Pixel is a small but ambitious digital design company based near Nice in the French Riviera. We love creating beautiful, effortless websites that drive the real-world growth of our clientsâ€™ businesses. We specialise in web design & development, front-end engineering and digital marketing activities.

We're shamelessly copying Aaron Draplin's idea of offering our Friday afternoons for free, for a good cause (it might not always be a Friday afternoon!). What does this mean? Well, if you are working on a non-profit project and you need some graphic design, web design or web development work doing as part of it, then send us a few short details and we'll consider offering our time and expertise for you for free, simple right?!

As long as it's not-for-profit, we'll consider it - it really can be anything: an event, a band website, a personal project, some fund raising activity, anything. Just send us some details and we'll get in touch to let you know what we think. Our contact details are below so get in touch today.
