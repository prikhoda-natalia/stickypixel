Sticky Pixel is a small but ambitious digital design company based near Nice in the French Riviera. We love creating beautiful, effortless websites that drive the real-world growth of our clients’ businesses. We specialise in web design & development, front-end engineering and digital marketing activities.

Due to high demand, we are seeking a web designer / front-end developer, initially on a freelance / part-time basis and hopefully leading to a full-time position. Our perfect match will be happy designing and developing beautiful websites, from concept to deployment according to our clients' specifications. We're not so fussed about how much experience you can bring (although it can help!) but we are interested in your attitude, passion and willingness to be part of building an amazing company.

##Things we’ll like best about you include your:
* Boundless passion for web design and front-end development
* Enthusiasm for learning new technologies
* Fantastic communication and customer service skills
* Experience of web design and development
* Deep knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Keen eye for detail
* Talent to quickly understand complex client requirements and suggest simple, logical solutions
* Desire for doing things right
* Ability to translate client requirements in to scope and specification documents

##Good to Have
* Knowledge of javascript frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, Backbone etc.
* Experience with SASS / LESS
* Experience with a build system such as Grunt or Gulp
* Knowledge of Git / Github
* UI / UX Development skills
* If you're based near Nice too then great but otherwise we're happy to consider remote working too

Interested? Then please let us know by sending a message to <mailto:chris@stickypixel.com> explaining in one sentence why you think you'd be a good fit for us. If you have one then please include your CV and Portfolio too.
